title: Reading SEC Data From EDGAR in C#
categories: [c#]
---

Since I've been working on side projects, moving to North Carolina, and generally having a life, I have not updated this blog much. That doesn't mean
I haven't been working on things, though. One of my more recent projects has been scraping the SEC EDGAR database for
public filing data on companies. Surprisingly, I found very little in the C# realm for doing this.

I wrote a bunch of stuff to help me grab the data and shove it into a database using [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/). Nothing earth shattering, but if you are interested in learning how to
evaluate companies, or you just want this kind of data, it's a great place to start.

Take a look at the [Github Project](https://github.com/hross/stock-info-downloader) for more info.
