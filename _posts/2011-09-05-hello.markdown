title: Adventures in GitHub Blogging
---

I got tired of [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) as a blogging platform awfully quickly. It ended up being too much for my needs (as is probably the case with anyone who is using it solely for blogging).

I stumbled across a couple of interesting solutions ([like hosting on s3](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2011/02/website_amazon_s3.html)). Ultimately, though, I like the idea of keeping it simple and having the content in a format I can easily export *and read with a text editor*.

[Windows Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer) is still the best blogging tool I've ever used... too bad I've started focusing some of my development efforts on my mac lately. Time to move back to a text editor...

Luckily, [github](http://github.com) has some awesome abilities to both version your blog and host it at the same time, thanks to [github pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Tom Preston Werner has an [interesting post about doing just that](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html), as do [some](http://alexyoung.org/2009/07/09/new-blog/) [other](http://ostatic.com/blog/build-your-site-with-jekyll) [people](https://github.com/jamesyu/jamesyu_jekyll_template).

Cool stuff:

* I can use [markdown](http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/) for my blog posts
* My entire blog is [automagically in source control](https://github.com/hross/hross.github.com)
* Updating entries is as simple as making changes using git
* Pretty much free, minus the cost of pointing a domain name at the blog if I so choose.
* Preston-Warner makes his [blog template freely available on github](https://github.com/mojombo/tpw)

Not as cool stuff:

* No fancy editors (I am more than okay with that)
* I have to maintain my own HTML templates, SEO, etc
* I have to use git (pro and con)
* Have to learn yet another templating language (Jekyll). This looks useful: [Jekyll Template Wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data).
* All my blog updates are public on github (unless I want to start paying them for private repos).
