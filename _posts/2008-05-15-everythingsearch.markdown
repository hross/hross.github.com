title: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Search (But Were Afraid to Ask)
categories: [webcenter]

As I mentioned previously on this blog, I'm at [BEA Participate][1] this week. In order to convince the powers that be to send me out here for free, I gave a presentation on Search Server. As usual, it was based on my initial lack of understanding of the product and subsequent painful discovery of its inner workings.

If you were here, I hope you enjoyed it. If you weren't, I'll try to write up a few detailed posts when I get some time. For now, here's a [link to the slide deck][2].

As for the conference itself, my hat is off to all the BEA folk who pulled it off. It was great to see our customers, partners and BEA employees at the event. It was definitely a reminder of the large number of smart, and fun, people I have the pleasure of working with on a regular basis. And a special kudos to [BDG][3], who pulled together a [really slick portal for the conference][1].
