I am not sure this is even enough for a blog post, but... well it is. Here are just a few the of cool things you can do with Google Translate:

1. Use the new audio capability to [generate audio translations of text](http://weston.ruter.net/projects/google-tts/), automatically.
2. Use the translate API to [translate your entire web page by simply including some javascript](http://translate.google.com/translate_tools?hl=en&layout=1&eotf=1).
3. Programmatically translate stuff using the [unofficial Java API](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-translate-java/). There is probably one for .NET, but I havenâ€™t tried it.
4. Translate bits and pieces of your web site, on demand, using a very cool jQuery plugin called [Sunday Morning](http://sundaymorning.jaysalvat.com/).
