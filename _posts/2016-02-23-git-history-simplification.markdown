I have been pretty busy working on our Git implementation in [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx) here at Microsoft, so I have not been posting much. 
However, I did find some time to write an article about [Git History Simplification](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/articles/git-log-history-simplification) over on the Visual Studio site.
